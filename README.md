# Senior-Capstone
This is an old Senior Capstone Project I did in college. It was a social media website for people to roleplay as their favorite characters and to chat with one-another. This was never ment to become an actual website, and was only for school purposes. The tools we used were HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.
